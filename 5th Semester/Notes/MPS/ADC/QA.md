### Answers

1. **Parameters of ADC Important for Analog to Digital Conversion:**
   - Resolution: The number of bits used to represent the analog input.
   - Sampling Rate: Frequency at which the ADC samples the analog signal.
   - Input Range: The range of analog values the ADC can convert.
   - Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): Ratio of signal power to noise power.
   - Linearity: The degree to which the conversion is proportional to the input.
   - Conversion Time: Time taken to convert an analog signal to digital form.
   - Power Consumption: Important for battery-powered devices.

2. **Minimum Sampling Rate for Analog Signal Conversion:**
   - According to the Nyquist Theorem, the minimum sampling rate should be at least twice the bandwidth (B) of the analog signal to avoid aliasing. Therefore, the minimum sampling rate = 2B.

3. **Quantization Noise and Reduction:**
   - Quantization noise is the error introduced by quantizing the analog signal. It occurs because the signal is rounded to the nearest quantization level.
   - It can be reduced by increasing the resolution (number of bits) of the ADC, which decreases the quantization step size.

4. **Reduction in Quantization Noise by Doubling Quantization Levels:**
   - Doubling the number of quantization levels effectively increases the resolution by one bit. This results in a 6 dB decrease in quantization noise (since quantization noise power decreases by half for each additional bit).

5. **Suitable ADC for Fast Analog to Digital Conversions:**
   - Flash ADC: Suitable for very high-speed conversions, albeit at a lower resolution.

6. **Improvement with Dual Slope ADC Compared to Single Slope ADC:**
   - Dual slope ADC offers improved noise rejection and accuracy compared to single slope ADC, especially in environments with fluctuating signal levels.

7. **Key Benefit of Delta-Sigma ADC:**
   - Delta-Sigma ADCs provide high resolution and accuracy, and are particularly effective in reducing noise through oversampling and noise shaping techniques.

8. **ADCs Suitable for Multiple Analog Inputs Using Analog Multiplexing:**
   - Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADCs are commonly used for multiplexing multiple analog inputs, due to their balance of speed and resolution.

9. **Control of Conversion Order in TM4C123 ADC Module:**
   - Yes, it is possible to control the order of analog signal conversion using the sample sequencer of the TM4C123 ADC module.

10. **Assigning Priorities to Different Analog to Digital Conversions:**
    - Priorities can be assigned by configuring the ADC’s control registers to select which channels or sequences are sampled first.

11. **Assigning Same Priority to Different Sample Sequencers in ADC Module:**
    - Typically, ADC modules allow different priority levels for each sequencer. Assigning the same priority might not be standard practice and could depend on the specific ADC module’s capabilities.

12. **Advantage of Oversampling and Sample Averaging in TM4C123 ADC Module:**
    - Oversampling and sample averaging can increase resolution and reduce noise, leading to more accurate ADC readings.

13. **Selective Enabling of Oversampling for TM4C123 ADC Sequencers:**
    - Yes, oversampling can typically be enabled selectively for different sequencers in the TM4C123 ADC module, allowing for customized configuration based on the needs of each sequencer.
