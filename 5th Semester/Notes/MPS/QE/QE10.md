##### Question 10.1 List the key application areas where timers are used as basic building blocks.
- Time keeping/Real-time clock
- Event counting
- Pulse width modulation
- Waveform generation
- Time measurement
- Time delays
- Watchdog timers

##### Question 10.2 What are different methods to generate a clock signal for a microcontroller?
- Crystal oscillator 
- Ceramic resonator
- RC oscillator circuit
- External clock source

##### Question 10.3 How can a microcontroller be operated at different clock frequencies, while using a fixed frequency oscillator?
By using a clock prescaler module that can divide the fixed frequency oscillator to generate lower clock frequencies.

##### Question 10.4 Is it possible to clock the microcontroller at a frequency lower than that of an oscillator? If the answer is yes, then how and if it is no, then why.
Yes it is possible to clock the microcontroller at a lower frequency than the oscillator using a prescaler. The prescaler divides the oscillator frequency to generate a lower frequency clock for the microcontroller.

##### Question 10.5 What is the main difference between a 16-bit and a 32-bit timer?
The main difference is that a 32-bit timer has a larger count range compared to a 16-bit timer. This allows it to measure larger time intervals before rolling over.

##### Question 10.6 What are possible choices to increase the timer resolution?
- Increase the timer input clock frequency
- Use a timer prescaler to divide the clock to a higher frequency
- Use a 32-bit timer instead of 16-bit timer

##### Question 10.7 How can the timer range be increased? What is the effect of increasing timer range on its resolution?
The timer range can be increased by using a timer with larger bit-width (e.g. 32-bit instead of 16-bit). 
Increasing the timer range decreases its resolution. For example a 16-bit timer has a resolution of 1/65536 of its range, while a 32-bit timer has a resolution of 1/4294967296.

##### Question 10.8 Is it possible to run Systick timer in count up mode? Can it be run at a clock frequency of 48 MHz?
No, Systick timer can only operate in down counting mode.

Yes, Systick timer has no restrictions on the clock frequency so it can operate at 48 MHz.

##### Question 10.9 What are the configuration steps to use a timer as an event counter?
The steps are:
1. Configure the timer in count-up mode
2. Enable interrupts on timer overflow 
3. Initialize timer count value to 0
4. Configure GPIO and interrupts to detect external events
5. On event detection, add 1 to timer count value in ISR
6. Timer count value contains number of events detected

##### Question 10.10 What is one count error and when does it become significant?
One count error occurs when an external event occurs after the timer value is read but before it is reset. This can lead to missing the count for that event.

It becomes significant when operating at high event rates, where multiple events can occur between reading and resetting the timer value.

##### Question 10.11 Under what conditions is period measurement more accurate than cycle counting when measuring the frequency of an external signal?
Period measurement is more accurate when the signal frequency is varying or unstable. By measuring the time period for multiple cycles and averaging, errors due to instability are reduced.

Cycle counting is accurate only for stable waveforms over the measurement interval.

##### Question 10.12 What are the key applications of pulse width modulation?  
Some key applications are:

- DC Motor speed control
- LED brightness control  
- Power Control
- Analog signal generation
- Transformers

##### Question 10.13 What type of signal is generated if the duty cycle register value does not change while the timer reload register value is increased linearly?  
A ramp waveform is generated because increasing the reload register linearly, while keeping duty cycle fixed, results in linear change in ON time of the PWM pulse.

##### Question 10.14 What are different operating modes of TM4C123 timer module?
The operating modes are:
- One-shot mode
- Periodic mode 
- Capture mode
- PWM mode
- External event counter mode

##### Question 10.15 How can the prescaler register in a timer module be used for increasing the timer range?
The prescaler divides the input clock frequency fed to the timer counter. By increasing the prescale value, the effective clock frequency decreases, which increases the time for the timer to overflow. This increases the timer range linearly with the prescale value.

##### Question 10.16 What value should be configured to port control register (GPIO PCTL R) to use a GPIO pin as timer input/output pin?
The GPIO PCTL register for the pin should be configured with a value corresponding to the timer peripheral, to connect the GPIO pin to that timer. For example, value 0x4 connects the pin to Timer 0.

##### Question 10.17  How is the duty cycle of a PWM signal updated in TM4C123 after each timer underflow?
The GPTM Timer Comparison Load (TAILR) register is used as the period register defining the PWM period. The GPTM Timer Match (TAMATCHR) register defines the PWM pulse width. By updating TAMATCHR, the duty cycle is updated after each timer underflow.

##### Exercise 10.1 What are the main advantages of using an internal oscillator compared to an external oscillator? In addition, list the disadvantages as well.
**Advantages:**

- Lower cost as external components are not required 
- Smaller form factor as external components require board space
- Lower power as internal oscillator draws less current

**Disadvantages:**  

- Lower frequency stability and accuracy
- Limited frequency range
- Environmental factors like temperature affect performance

##### Exercise 10.2 Write a C program to reconfigure the TM4C123 clock frequency to 64 MHz.

```c
#include "TM4C123GH6PM.h"

int main(void) {

  // Configure PLL to output 64 MHz
  SYSCTL->RCC |= (1<<20);  // Use PLL as system clock
  SYSCTL->RCC &= ~(1<<21); // Bypass PLL when initializing
  
  SYSCTL->PLLCFG |= (1<<23); // Set PLL bypass bit  
  SYSCTL->PLLCFG = (4<<0) | (0x5A<<8); // Configure PLL
  
  while ((SYSCTL->PLLSTAT & (1<<3)) == 0) {}; // Wait for PLL lock  
  
  SYSCTL->RCC |= (1<<22);  // Enable use of PLL
  
  // Configure flash wait states 
  FLASH->FMA = 0x33;
  
  // Set system clock divider
  SYSCTL->RCC &= ~(1<<30);
  SYSCTL->RCC |= (1<<27); // 64 MHz clock   
  
  return 0;
}
```

##### Exercise 10.3 Assume that a timer is running from a clock frequency of 16 MHz. What should the timer reload value be to generate a timer interrupt every 1 ms, when the timer is running in (a) count down mode and (b) count up mode?
(a) Count down mode: 
   Reload value = Timer frequency / Interrupt frequency 
             = 16 MHz / 1 kHz = 16,000

(b) Count up mode:
   Reload value = Timer frequency / Interrupt frequency - 1  
            = 16 MHz / 1 kHz - 1 = 15,999

##### Exercise 10.4 An external source generates events aperiodically. We want to generate an interrupt after every fifth event. What timer configuration can be used to solve this problem?
Configure the timer in count-up event counter mode to increment on each external event. Set the timer reload value to 5. Enable the timer interrupt to trigger on overflow, which will happen after the 5th event. 

In the timer ISR, reset the counter to start counting for the next 5 events.

##### Exercise 10.5 Write a C program for generating 1 kHz square wave on PA5 (i.e., port A pin 5) using the Systick timer. Assume that the Systick timer is operating at a bus clock frequency of 16 MHz.
```c
#include "TM4C123GH6PM. h" 

#define TIMER_RELOAD (16000 - 1)

void SysTick_Handler (void) {
  
  GPIOC->DATA ^= (1<<5); // Toggle PA5
  
}

int main (void){

  SYSCTL->RCGCGPIO |= (1<<0); // Enable Port A clock
  
  GPIOA->DIR |= (1<<5); // Set PA5 as output  
  GPIOA->DEN |= (1<<5); // Set PA5 as digital pin 
  
  SysTick->LOAD = TIMER_RELOAD; // Load reload value
  SysTick->VAL = 0; // Clear current value
  SysTick->CTRL = 0x07; // Enable with core clock, interrupts
  
  return 0;
}
```

##### Exercise 10.6  A 16-bit down counter based timer is driven by a timer clock frequency of 16 MHz. We are interested in generating 100 ms intervals as timer interrupts. What reload value should be used to generate this interval from the timer? You are free to use timer pre-scaler if required.
Timer frequency f = 16 MHz  

Required interrupt interval T = 100 ms = 0.1 sec  

As the maximum 16-bit value is 65535, prescaling is required to achieve the large interval.

With /256 prescaler, timer frequency is 16 MHz/256 = 62.5 kHz

Reload value N = Timer frequency * Time interval  
            = 62.5 kHz * 0.1 sec = 6250

Use a prescale value of 256 and reload value of 6250.

##### Exercise 10.7 Pedestrian Signal Crossing: A person uses a pedestrian signal to stop the road traffic and cross the road...

[Question details omitted for brevity]

... Write a C program to implement the above functionality. Clearly specify the required interrupt and timer configurations.  

#  

Timer 0 is used with periodic mode and interrupts to implement the timing functionality. The switch press is detected using GPIO Port B interrupt.

```c
// GPIO PB3 switch interrupt enables Timer0
void GPIOB_Handler (void) {

  Timer0->CTL |= 0x100; // Enable Timer0 after switch press  
  
  Timer1->CTL &=~0x100; // Disable Timer1 
  GPIOB->ICR |= 1<<3; // Clear interrupt flag

}

//Timer0 15 sec timeout interrupt 
void Timer0A_Handler (void){
  
  Timer0->CTL &=~0x100; // Disable Timer0

  Timer1->CTL |= 0x100; // Start Timer1
  
}  

// Timer1 controls signals 
void Timer1A_Handler (void){

  GPIOB->DATA ^= (1<<4) | (1<<5);  // Toggle Traffic signals
  GPIOB->DATA ^= (1<<6) | (1<<7); // Toggle Pedestrian signals  

}

int main (void) {

  // GPIOB pins 3-7 output
  GPIOB->DIR |=  0xF8; 
  GPIOB->DEN |= 0xF8;   

  // Enable switch interrupt
  GPIOB->IM |= (1<<3);  
  NVIC->ISER[0] |= 1 << (INT_GPIOB-16);

  // Configure Timer0 and Timer1 in periodic, interrupt mode  
  
  return 0;
}
```

##### Exercise 10.8 Consider the time period based frequency measurement discussed in Example 10.5. What is the maximum frequency that can be measured reliably using this method, while measurement error does not exceed 1%?  
From Example 10.5:
Error percentage = 100 x (Interrupt latency)/Time period

Requirement: Error percentage ≤ 1%
           
Let f = Frequency to be measured
T = Time period = 1/f
I = Interrupt latency (in sec)

Then, 100 x I/T ≤ 1
or,        I ≤ 0.01T = 0.01/f

I = 200 cycles (given)  
       = 200/Clock frequency (in Hz)

Substituting I and solving for f:
f ≤ Clock frequency/20000  

Therefore, the maximum frequency that can be reliably measured is Clock frequency/20000.

For 16 MHz clock, max frequency is 16 MHz/20000 = 800 Hz.

##### Exercise 10.9 The interrupt entry latency (IEL) is defined as the number of processor clock cycles from the generation of an interrupt signal until the start of execution of first instruction in the corresponding interrupt service routine...

[Question details omitted for brevity]  

... It is required to measure the IEL for timer interrupt handler to an accuracy of 10 clock cycles. Suggest a method to measure it using the processor itself without an external measurement device. What changes will be required if exact IEL measurement is desired, rather than accuracy to 10 clock cycles?

Method to measure IEL with 10 clock cycle accuracy:

1. Configure Timer0 in count-up mode with interrupts on overflow. 
2. Set up GPIO pin as output to toggle on Timer0 ISR entry
3. In Timer0 ISR, read Timer1 free running counter value (T1), toggle GPIO, reset Timer0 counter.
4. In main, load a large overflow value to Timer0 
5. Wait for Timer0 ISR to execute, record Timer1 counter (T2)
6. IEL = T2 - T1

For exact IEL measurement:

1. Use two 32-bit timers instead of 16-bit Timer0/Timer1. 
2. Start a capture timer on interrupt signal, stop timer on ISR first instruction.
3. This avoids timer overflow errors for large IEL.
