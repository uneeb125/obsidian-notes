##### Q 11.1. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous serial communication interface?

| Synchronous             | Asynchronous                        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Clock sent              | Clock absent                        |
| More Hardware           | Less Hardware                       |
| No Start Stop overhead  | Start and Stop overhead             |
| Continuous Transmission | Discontinuous discrete Transmission | 

##### Q 11.2. How does the full-duplex serial interface differ from half-duplex interface?
Full-duplex allows simultaneous transmission and reception
Half-duplex only allows both transmission and reception but not simultaneously.   

##### Q 11.3. Why is serial communication interface preferred over its parallel counterpart?
Serial interface uses less hardware (less pins and wires), simpler and cheaper than parallel.

##### Question 11.4. What are the key differences between UART and RS232 based serial interfaces?

- UART includes the transmit and receive buffers, baud rate generators, control registers, etc. It takes bytes of data and converts them into sequential bits for serial transmission, and vice versa on the receiver side.
- RS232 refers to a specific standardized interface between data terminal equipment (DTE) and data communication equipment (DCE). It specifies electrical signal levels and a protocol for communication between devices. Some key points:
**Summary:**
- UART is the hardware that handles serialization/deserialization and timing i.e  transmit and receive buffers, baud rate generators, control registers.
- RS232 defines additional specifications like voltage levels, connectors, cable length that allow inter-operation

##### Q 11.5. If the UART Rx pin is connected to ground by accident, then what type of error condition will be generated by the UART interface?
- First Framing error will occur.
- If it continues for 2 Stop bits we get Break error

##### Q 11.6. Consider a situation where a new UART frame is received, while the previously received frame is not processed. What type of error should be expected in such a scenario?  
Overrun error.

##### Q 11.7. While transmitting one data byte using UART frame, is it possible to transmit the MSB as the first transmitted data bit after the start bit?   
No, the spec requires that LSB be sent first after start bit.   

##### Q 11.8. What is the significance of the ratio of UART interface clock frequency to UART baud rate?
Determines sampling rate to match incoming data rate.

##### Q 11.9. When TM4C123 is operating at a system clock frequency of 16 MHz, what is the maximum achievable baud rate?   
6.25 Mbps (16 MHz / 16).

##### Q 11.10. Why should UART interrupt flag be cleared before exiting the corresponding UART ISR? This justification is equally valid for other serial communication interfaces as well.  
To prevent unintended re-entry into ISR.

##### Q 11.11. Is I2C bus single- or multi-master? What about SPI and CAN buses?
I2C is multi-master, SPI and CAN are multi-master.   

##### Q 11.12. How are START and STOP conditions generated on an I2C bus interface?
- SDA pulled low while SCL is high for **START**
- SDA pulled high while SCL is high for **STOP**

##### Q 11.13. Is it possible for two devices, connected to the I2C bus, to have the same slave addresses?  
No, each device must have a unique address.

##### Q 11.14. What value should be configured to port control register (GPIO PCTL R) to use a GPIO pin as I2C interface pin?   
0x00000022 to enable I2C function.   

##### Q 11.15. What are different modes of operation for SPI bus?
Master, slave, multi-master.

HL##### Q 11.16. How do we define SPI clock phase and its polarity?   
Clock phase controls when data is captured, polarity controls clock signal active high or low.   

##### Q 11.17. In case of simultaneous transmissions from two or more nodes, how are collisions resolved on the CAN bus?
Bitwise arbitration based on message ID.
