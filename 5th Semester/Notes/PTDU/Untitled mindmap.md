- Balanced 3-Phase
	- Y-Connections
		- Line to Neutral Voltages
			- Properties
				- **Balanced** if load impedance on each line is equal.
				- **Positive sequence or abc sequence** when $E_{an}$ leads $E_{bn}$ by $120\degree$ and $E_{bn}$ leads $E_{cn}$ by $120\degree$.
				- **Negative sequence or acb sequence** when $E_{an}$ leads $E_{cn}$ by $120\degree$ and $E_{cn}$ leads $E_{bn}$ by $120\degree$.
		- Line to Line Voltages
			- The **clockwise** arrangement of the line to line voltages indicates a **positive sequence**.
			- Since a **line to line** voltage vectors form a closed triangle their **sum is always zero**, *even in unbalanced*. $$E_{ab} + E_{bc} + E_{ca} = 0$$
			- But for Line to Neutral voltages this is only true for **Balanced**. $$E_{an} + E_{bn} + E_{cn} = 0$$

		- Line Currents
			- If **balanced this neutral current is zero**, because of closed phasor triangle.
