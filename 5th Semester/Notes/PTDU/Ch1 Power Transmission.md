# Structure of Power Transmission System
## Primary Transmission
1. Generated at $15kV-25kV$ (12.5 kV at Mangla) `Delta`
### Power Plant Substation
1. Step-up from $11kV \rightarrow 220kV\space or\space 500kV$ `Delta-Wye`
## Secondary Transmission
### Transmission Substation
1. Step-down from $220kV\space or\space 500kV \rightarrow 132 kV$
2. Transmission SubStations
3. Step-Down $33kV \rightarrow 11kV$
## Primary Distribution
1. Sub-Station
2. Step Down $11kV \rightarrow 415kV$
## Secondary Distribution

- Fuel cell
## Carbon Collection
- **Post-combustion:** CO2 captured from the flue gas after combustion.
Capture and stored underground, before reaching the stack.
- **Pre-combustion:** Removal of CO2 from the fossil fuel prior to combustion. 
Fuel converted to hydrogen and CO2 captured.
- **Oxy-fuel:** Combustion of fossile fuel with pure oxygen rather than air.
Pure CO2 and water vapor produced.

## Fossil Fuel Plants.
- Steam turbines spin at 3600 or 1800 rpm
- Generator two-pole for 3600 and four-pole for 1800.
### Coal Fired
1. Coal crushed, pulverized to powder, mixed with air.
2. Heat used to produce steam at high temp and pressure.
3. Steam Dried and superheated by the flue(chimney) gases.
4. Through control valve into HP turbine.
5. Control valve modulates according to power demand.
6. Steam goes to re-heating tubes, then sent to MP turbines, then to LP turbines.
7. Steam moves to condenser.
8. Condensate pump drives water through reheater, sends to feed water pump, then loop again.
9. Heat in cooling water removed by natural, forced or induced draft cooling towers. Some use river or lake water.
10. Products of combustion moved towards stack scrubbers and antipollution apparatus, then exhausted.
