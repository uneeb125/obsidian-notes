# Structure of Power Transmission System
## Primary Transmission
1. Generated at $15kV-25kV$ (12.5 kV at Mangla)
2. Step-up from $11kV \rightarrow 220kV or 500kV$
3. Step-down from $132kV \rightarrow 22 kV$
## Secondary Transmission
1. Receiving Station
2. Step-Down $33kV \rightarrow 11kV$
## Primary Distribution
1. Sub-Station
2. Step Down $11kV \rightarrow 415kV$
## Secondary Distribution
