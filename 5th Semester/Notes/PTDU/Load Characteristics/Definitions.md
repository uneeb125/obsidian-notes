## Load
The actual power requirement at any point in time
## Demand
Load that is averaged out over a time interval
## Demand Interval
This denotes the time period 15min, 30 min, 1hr or longer
## Maximum Demand
In the demand interval the maximum the instantaneous load reaches.
## Average Load Demand
Simple average power in that period
$$
P_{av}= \frac{Total\quad energy}{Total\quad time}
$$
## Load Duration Curve
When load elements of a load curve are arranged in decreasing magnitude.

## Load Factor ($F_{LD}$)
$$
F_{LD} = \frac{\text{Average Load}}{\text{Peak Load}}
$$
## Connected Load
Sum of all the continuous ratings of loads connected
## Demand Factor (DF)
Maximum Demand over Total 
$$
DF = \frac{\text{Maximum Demand}}{\text{Total Connected Load}}
$$
## Diversified Demand
Sum of Demands imposed over a time period
## Maximum Diversified Demand
Maximum of the sum of the demands imposed by a group over a particular period.
## Non-coincident Demand
Sum of individual demands without restrictuion o fthem happening at the same time
## Diversity Factor ($F_D$)
$$
F_{D} = \frac{\text{Sum of individual maximum demands}}{\text{Coincident maximum demand}}
$$

- Greater diversity lowers cost of generation.

## Domestic Load
lights fans refreigerators
load factor 10% to 12%
## Commercial Load
Weather and time of day dependant.
## Industrial Load
Not weather dependent
## Municipal Load
Street lights. Pumping at low peak period.
## Irrigation Load
12 hours during night
## Traction Load
High variance due to rush hours
