# Corona
If suface potential gradient of a conductor exceeds the dielectric strength of surronding air. Partial ionization is known as coronoa.

- Air dielectric at NTP ($25\degree C\space and\space 76\space cm\space of\space Hg$) 30 kV/cm

## Disadvantages
- Power loss
- Audible hissing
- Ozone production
- Radio and Television interference.

## Factors of extent
### Conductor
- Conductor diameter
- Line config
- Type of conductor
- Condition of surface
	Particle at surface can at as a point charge concentrating the field there increasing ionization
- Impurities within the surface
	Conductors may be impure having dust in them.
### Air
- Air density
- Humidity (rain corona many times higher)
- Wind

## Corrective measures
- Increase conductor size
- Use conductor bundling
- Periodic cleaning of insulators
