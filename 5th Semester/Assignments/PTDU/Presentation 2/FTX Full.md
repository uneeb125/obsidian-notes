## Deliverables 1
### FTX and Management Issues

FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange, grew rapidly under CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. However, it collapsed in November 2022 amid allegations of mismanagement of customer funds. This raises several issues for management:

### Sources of Competitive Advantage

- FTX's trading platform and ability to facilitate crypto transactions gave it a competitive edge. 

- Brand reputation and trust are key in financial services.

### Evolving Nature of Management 

- Management must balance rapid growth and innovation with appropriate controls and governance.

- With crypto being new technology, oversight and regulation are still evolving. Managers must navigate ambiguous regulations.

### Management at Different Levels

- Strategic missteps by top-level executives led to FTX's troubles. However, mid-level risk management could have provided more oversight.

- Operational controls over accounting, auditing and technical systems were lacking. All levels of management share responsibility.

### Skills for Effective Management

- Technical skills in crypto finance and trading platforms were a strength at FTX. However, managerial controls, governance, ethics and risk management were weak.

- Effective managers need a balance of technical, human, and conceptual skills. FTX shows technical skills alone are not enough.

### Organizational Culture 

- FTX prioritized rapid growth and moving fast. This culture lacked appropriate caution and governance.

- Management must foster a culture with ethical values and accountability built in. The culture should balance innovation with governance.

### Environmental Influences 

- Cryptocurrency represents an emerging technology space with evolving regulations. FTX struggled to adapt its controls fast enough.

- Economic conditions also shifted in 2022, exposing risky practices that worked in a bull market. Management must adapt to changing contexts.

### Competitive Environment

- The crypto exchange market has many new entrants and loose regulations. This competitive landscape allowed FTX's risky practices to go unchecked.

- Managers must watch competitors for unsafe practices that could damage the whole industry's reputation.

### Economic and Social Developments

- The crypto bubble bursting in 2022 led to financial losses for FTX customers, damaging trust. Managers must watch economic conditions.

- Cryptocurrency's social impacts are still evolving. Responsible managers should consider how innovations affect society.

### Ethical Perspectives 

- FTX failed to make customer protection a top priority, instead chasing growth and revenues. This reflects egoism and shareholder primacy perspectives.

- Stakeholder, rights, justice, and utilitarian ethics should have guided decisions to build controls that protected clients.

### Ethical Issues  

- Misuse of customer funds for high-risk investing violates fiduciary duty. Lack of transparency and misrepresented reserves were deceptive.

- Managers had conflicting interests between company growth and client protection. Greater emphasis on ethics was needed.

### Ethical Decision Making

- Managers should have identified risks to customers, analyzed alternatives, determined which option upheld duties to clients, and implemented controls.

- Getting input from diverse stakeholders could have surfaced ethical concerns. An ethics code and training could have helped align values.

### Corporate Social Responsibility

- FTX failed to consider investor protection and transparency as part of its CSR obligations. It did make some philanthropic contributions.

- Managers must integrate CSR into strategy and operations. This includes ethical accounting, investor protection, risk management, and governance controls.

### Environmental Management

- Crypto's environmental impacts should have been considered, as mining coins like Bitcoin consumes substantial energy.

- Managers could engage in carbon offsets for operations, promote energy-efficient mining techniques, and invest in renewable energy.

### Recommendations for FTX

- Implement controls and segregation of funds to protect client assets and ensure proper accounting and auditing.

- Create robust risk management under experienced executives separate from growth objectives. 

- Foster an ethical culture with transparency, integrity, and customer protection as core values.

- Reform corporate governance with independent directors to provide oversight.

- Work cooperatively with regulators and bankruptcy proceedings to maximize recovery for creditors.

The collapse of FTX demonstrates the importance of controls, ethics and balanced management priorities - not just rapid growth and innovation. By implementing ethical practices and governance, crypto companies can build trust and responsibility.
