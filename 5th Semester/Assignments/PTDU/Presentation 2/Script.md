Hello there I will be outlining some of the problems faced by twitter. Since Twitter is a social media company, these problems will primarily focus on the ethics of modern business management.

Overall we will observe that business strategies are not a one size fits all scenario. In fact, they must be adapted to the specific business and its environment. This fact was completely ignored after the acquisition of twitter by Elon Musk.

In a bid to overcome the negative cash flow of 4M dollar year on year. Elon started doing cost cutting.

### Mass Lay-offs
First on the chopping block was the large workforce. Elon brought forward multiple waves of mass-layoffs to shed as mush weight as possible from the company. Before the acquisition the workforce stood at around 7500 employees after the lay-offs, which means 76% of twitters workforce got layed-off

Reasonably this lead to accusations of labor law violations. And many lawsuits.

### Discriminatory Firing
These firings were mean as a cost-cutting measure, its no wonder that certain groups would likely be unfairly targeted. An investigation the Department of Economics at Retgurs university showed that 60% of over 50 and 54% of under 50.
