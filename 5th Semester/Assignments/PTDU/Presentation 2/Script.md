Hello there I will be outlining some of the problems faced by twitter. Since Twitter is a social media company, these problems will primarily focus on the ethics of modern business management.

Overall we will observe that business strategies are not a one size fits all scenario. In fact, they must be adapted to the specific business and its environment. This fact was completely ignored after the acquisition of twitter by Elon Musk.

In a bid to overcome the negative cash flow of 4M dollar year on year. Elon started doing cost cutting.

### Mass Lay-offs
`First on the chopping block was the large workforce. Elon brought forward multiple waves of mass-layoffs to shed as mush weight as possible from the company. `Before the acquisition the workforce stood at around 7500 employees after the lay-offs, which means 76% of twitters workforce got layed-off

Reasonably this lead to accusations of labor law violations. And many lawsuits.

### Discriminatory Firing
These firings were mean as a cost-cutting measure, so of course they would affect certain groups more severley. An investigation the Department of Economics at Retgurs university showed that 
- 60% of over 50 and 54% of under 50.
- 57% of females and 47% of males.

Lastly is the case of the twitter employee that disagreed with one of Elon's decision in a private slack group and subsiquently got fired.


### Misinformation
The decision by Musk to make Twitter a free speech haven has undoubtedly lead to it being full of misinformation and propaganda all the way from 
- Political Slander
- Propaganda  regarding Ukraine-Russia conflict
- Most recently the Israel propaganda attempting to cover up the mass genocide still in effect in Gaza.

### Impersonation
I find it a bit poetic, that the first person to get impersonated was Elon Musk himself, with trolls and parody  mocking mocking him at every step
Although it has had serious consequences for other companies as well a tweet an account impersonating as Eli Lily an american pharmaceuticals company saying that they were making insulin free. This caused a severe drop in the market evaluation.

### API access
Twitter is a vast source of human generated content and hence is the target of many AI companies looking or training data.
- This scrapping of data causes significant load of twitter's server
- There is also concern of Artist's work being used without permission.

### Web Scrapping
- Apart from API requests we also see a large resource load from web scraper, where computer of organization are sent onto the internet to gather information.
- They request posts comments and post meta data.

### The Rebrand
- The rebrand of twitter to X made people feel completely disconnected from platform.
- Most users are completely against the rebrand, this is quite apparent still use the word twitter not X. Just like I have referred to it as twitter throughout my presentation


Now I hand over
